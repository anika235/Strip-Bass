Generate an interactive multi-page EDA dashboard using JavaScript and HTML. The dashboard should analyze a dataset with three sections: null values, numeric features, and categorical features. Display null counts and percentages per column in the first section. For numeric features, show histograms, box plots, and basic statistics (mean, median, min, max). For categorical features, include bar charts for value counts and pie charts for distribution. Use a navigation menu to switch between sections. Load the dataset from a CSV file and ensure the dashboard is responsive and visually clean.
