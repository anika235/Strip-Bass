Create a simple web app called “You’ve Got 10 Minutes” where users receive a random creative prompt and have 10 minutes to complete it. Display a random idea and a tool (e.g., drawing, writing, coding) when the page loads. Start a countdown timer from 10:00 automatically and show motivational messages at intervals (e.g., “Keep going!” at 5 minutes). When the timer ends, disable input and show a message like “Time’s up!” Build the timer and random prompt logic using JavaScript, and use basic HTML for layout and minimal styling.
