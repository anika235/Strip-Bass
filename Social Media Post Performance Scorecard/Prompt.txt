Craft a tool to create interactive social media post performance scorecards. Build a workspace to input a scorecard title (e.g., “Post Performance”), add data like engagement rates or post types, and choose a focus area (e.g., Content, Analytics) from a dropdown. Show a live, editable scorecard preview using a simple JS table, letting users refine or delete scores. Ensure a clean, responsive layout. Add a reset button to clear the scorecard.
