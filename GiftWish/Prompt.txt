Create a web app using Plotly, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript where users can build and share wishlists with a social twist. Design a card-based wishlist creator with drag-and-drop item slots for adding products. Include a collaboration mode for group gifting, allowing multiple users to contribute. Add a search bar powered by Plotly to visualize product suggestion trends (e.g., bar charts for popularity). Implement a “fulfilled” animation with confetti using Plotly’s animated scatter plots. Create a community feed to display public wishlists with interactive Plotly charts showing item categories. Ensure a responsive, cheerful gift-box-themed design compatible across devices. Use Plotly for data visualization (e.g., wishlists stats) and output as HTML. Prioritize smooth UX and vibrant aesthetics.
