Assemble a web application where users can compile highlight reels for social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube Shorts. Use a single HTML file with vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and Konva.js (via CDN) for an interactive timeline canvas. Store reel assets, such as video clips, transitions, or text overlays, in a local JSON or mock dataset. Allow users to select a platform and arrange assets through a drag-and-drop interface, previewing the reel sequence in real time. Display an engagement impact score in a side panel based on content pacing and visual appeal. Use Tailwind CSS (via CDN) for a vibrant, responsive layout that works across devices. Include buttons to save reels to localStorage and export as a JSON file. Add a trending transition suggestion and a light/dark mode switch.
