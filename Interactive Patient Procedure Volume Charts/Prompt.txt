Construct a platform to generate interactive patient procedure volume charts. Create a panel to specify a chart title (e.g., “Procedure Volumes”), input data like procedure counts or types, and pick a focus area (e.g., Surgery, Analytics) from a dropdown. Display a live, editable Chart.js bar chart preview, allowing users to refine or delete data bars. Ensure a clean, responsive design. Add a reset button to wipe the chart.
