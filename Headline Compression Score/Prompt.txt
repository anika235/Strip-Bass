Generate a React app called “Headline Compression Score” that allows users to input a news headline and returns a compression score based on how much information is conveyed per word. Display the score along with a brief explanation of the calculation. Include a few example headlines in the code that users can click to test the app. Implement a simple algorithm that assigns higher scores to headlines that use fewer words to communicate more distinct ideas.
