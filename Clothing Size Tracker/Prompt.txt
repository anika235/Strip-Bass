Innovate a JavaScript app that lets users log clothing sizes by brand and category (e.g., jeans, shirts). Allow users to input their usual size and how a brandâ€™s sizing compares (e.g., runs small, true to size). Store data locally and display a dashboard showing trends or average size differences by brand. Implement a simple prediction feature that suggests the best size when the user selects a brand and item type.
