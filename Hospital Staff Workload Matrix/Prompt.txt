Develop a solution to create interactive hospital staff workload matrices. Build a console to specify a matrix title (e.g., “Workload Matrix”), input data like hours or tasks, and pick a focus area (e.g., HR, Operations) from a dropdown. Display a live, editable matrix preview using a simple JS grid, letting users refine or delete entries. Ensure a sleek, responsive interface. Add a reset button to clear the matrix.
