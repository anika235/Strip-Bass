Create a web app to design interactive patient wellness goal visualizers. Use one HTML file with CSS and JavaScript. Design a form to set a visualizer title (e.g., “Wellness Goals”), input data like fitness or mental health targets, and pick a department (e.g., Wellness, Analytics) from a dropdown. Display a live, editable radial gauge preview using a simple JS library, letting users adjust or delete goals. Ensure a clean, responsive interface. Add a reset button to clear the visualizer.
