Launch a web app for HR teams to create dynamic employee conflict mediation protocol templates. Use a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript, avoiding persistent data storage. Build a form to input a protocol title (e.g., “Conflict Mediation Process”), add sections like steps or roles, and select a department via dropdown for relevance. Display a real-time preview of the protocol with options to edit or remove sections, without saving. Validate title and section content for minimum length. Use Tailwind CSS via CDN for a responsive, modern interface. Include a button to reset the protocol. Provide predefined section templates (e.g., resolution guidelines) for quick creation. Write clean code, ensure intuitive navigation, and deliver smooth functionality for a seamless user experience across mobile and desktop devices.
