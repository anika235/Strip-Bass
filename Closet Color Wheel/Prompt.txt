Compose a JavaScript app where users can input clothing item names along with their associated colors. The app should store and display this data visually in a circular "closet color wheel" using HTML elements or a canvas. Each color should be represented proportionally based on frequency. Include a way to highlight which colors are overrepresented and which are missing based on standard color categories. Allow users to update or remove items, and make sure the visualization updates dynamically.
