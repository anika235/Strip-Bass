Build a web app to design interactive email engagement funnel graphs. Use one HTML file with CSS and JavaScript. Create a form to input a graph title (e.g., “Email Funnel”), add data like open-to-click rates or stages, and pick a department (e.g., Email Marketing, Analytics) from a dropdown. Show a live, editable Chart.js funnel graph preview, letting users tweak or remove data points. Ensure a clean, responsive design. Add a reset button to clear the graph.
