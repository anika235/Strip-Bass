Create a Shape-Based Drawing Challenge using JavaScript. When the user clicks a button, display a randomly selected shape from a predefined list (like a triangle, squiggle, or blob). Show the shape using basic HTML and CSS or a canvas element. The userâ€™s task is to interpret and turn the shape into a creative drawing idea. Allow reshuffling to generate new shapes without refreshing the page.
