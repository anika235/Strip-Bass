Create a JavaScript project that visualizes topics from a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model using interactive plots. Load a preprocessed LDA model output (provided as a JSON file with topics and their top words) and display an interactive scatter plot where each point represents a topic, sized by its prevalence. Clicking a topic reveals a bar chart of its top words with their probabilities. Include a simple HTML interface with a button to toggle between scatter and bar chart views, styled with basic CSS.
