Create a web app to craft interactive social media post reach line graphs. Design a form to input a graph title (e.g., “Post Reach”), add data like reach or posting dates, and choose a department (e.g., Social Media, Analytics) from a dropdown. Show a live, editable Chart.js line graph preview, letting users modify or delete data points. Ensure a sleek, responsive interface. Add a reset button to clear the graph.
