Create a web-based drawing app using JavaScript and HTML that allows users to draw with their mouse or touch input on a canvas element. The app should track whether the user lifts the input device and restrict drawing to a single continuous line. If the user lifts the mouse or finger, the drawing should be considered incomplete and prompt them to restart. Include basic UI to clear the canvas and start over. Display a message when a complete one-line drawing is made without any interruption.
