Invent a JavaScript project that allows users to design a personal uniform they would wear every day for a month. Build a simple interface where users can choose and customize clothing items like tops, bottoms, and accessories using HTML and JavaScript. Let them preview their outfit visually by selecting styles, colors, and combining items on a digital figure or layout. Include functionality to save their final outfit choice and revisit it later.
