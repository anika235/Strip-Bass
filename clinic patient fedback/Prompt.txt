Craft a solution to create interactive clinic patient feedback sentiment charts. Build a form to input a chart title (e.g., “Feedback Sentiment”), add data like positive or negative responses, and choose a focus area (e.g., Patient Experience, Analytics) from a dropdown. Display a live, editable Chart.js polar area chart preview, letting users refine or remove data points. Ensure a clean, responsive layout. Add a reset button to wipe the chart.
