Create a "Pack It or Leave It?" game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in a single HTML file. The game generates a list of 10 random items (e.g., hairdryer, rubber chicken, umbrella) from a predefined array of at least 30 quirky objects. Display a randomly selected destination (e.g., beach, Arctic, space station) with a brief description of its conditions (e.g., weather, environment). The user must decide whether to pack or leave each item within a 30-second timer, earning points based on appropriate choices (e.g., +10 for packing sunscreen for the beach, -5 for irrelevant items like a scarf). Implement a scoring system, display real-time feedback for each choice, and show a final score with a witty message based on performance. Use Tailwind CSS via CDN for styling and ensure the game is responsive and visually engaging.
