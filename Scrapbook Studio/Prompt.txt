Objective: Build a web-based digital scrapbook studio using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Plotly for interactive visualizations. Create a drag-and-drop canvas where users can arrange photos, stickers, and handwritten-style text to design personalized memory collections. Implement a template library with 3-5 pre-designed layouts accessible via a sidebar. Add a collaborative mode using WebSockets for real-time group contributions (2-3 users). Include a flipbook-style preview with Plotly animations for page-turn effects. Design a responsive layout with a whimsical, craft-inspired aesthetic (pastel colors, textured backgrounds). Ensure a sidebar for asset management (upload, select, delete) and sharing options for social platforms (e.g., download as PDF). Optimize for desktop and mobile, using Plotly for interactive elements like zoomable canvases and animated transitions.
