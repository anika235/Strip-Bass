Create a Decimal Abacus Visualizer that helps learners connect whole numbers and decimals using a familiar, interactive abacus format. Display rods labeled for each place value, including Thousands, Hundreds, Tens, Ones, Tenths, and Hundredths. Users can slide beads up or down on each rod to build numbers like 3.47, with the live value updating in real time above the abacus. Visually separate the whole number and decimal rods with a line or color change to reinforce the concept of the decimal point. Optionally include a “target number” mode where users are challenged to match a given decimal (e.g., “Make 5.62”), with hints and feedback. Use only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—no external libraries or datasets. Focus on intuitive bead movement, clear decimal structure, and hands-on exploration to bridge understanding between whole numbers and parts of a whole through place value.
