Construct a JavaScript app where the user enters their name, and the app generates a stylized logo based on that input. The logo should include different font styles, text layouts, and basic shape backgrounds like circles or rectangles. Let users cycle through a few style presets or refresh to generate new combinations. Use HTML to display the logo dynamically, and apply styles using CSS or inline styles via JavaScript. Include a clear input field and a generate button.
