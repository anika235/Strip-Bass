Develop an interactive Plotly.js web app to visualize color harmony rules (complementary, analogous, triadic, tetradic) using a dynamic color wheel. Users can select a base color via a color picker, and the app will display harmonized colors on the wheel with corresponding hex codes. Include buttons to switch between harmony rules, updating the visualization instantly. Use Plotly.js for the wheel and annotations, styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern UI. Ensure responsiveness and smooth transitions. Output as a single HTML file with CDN dependencies.
