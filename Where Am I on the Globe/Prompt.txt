Create a "Where Am I on the Globe?" Spinner app that lets users interact with a virtual globe rendered using SVG or canvas. Users can click and drag to spin the globe, and then drop a pin at any random point by clicking on a location. Once the pin is placed, the app reveals fun mock facts about the selected spot, such as the continent, nearby capital city, average temperature, and a fun cultural or geographic fact. The globe interaction should feel smooth and intuitive, and the pin placement triggers a quick info card or panel with the details. You can use a simplified world map with clickable regions for easier implementation. Use only HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptâ€”no external libraries. Focus on playful discovery, visual feedback, and mock geographic data to spark curiosity and exploration through hands-on interaction with the world.
